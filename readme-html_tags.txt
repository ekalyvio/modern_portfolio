----------- header -----------
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
logo or icon
authorship information
You can have several <header> elements in one document.

Note: A <header> tag cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.

----------- main -----------

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.

The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.

----------- i -----------

The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content of the <i> tag is usually displayed in italic.

The <i> tag can be used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name, etc.

Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

<em> (emphasized text)
<strong> (important text)
<mark> (marked/highlighted text)
<cite> (the title of a work)
<dfn> (a definition term)
